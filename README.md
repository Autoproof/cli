# autoproofcli

autoproofcli is a Golang project that provides a command-line interface for automatic code & content protection.

## Installation

To install autoproofcli, make sure you have Golang installed on your system. 
If you don't have Golang installed, you can download it from the official Golang website: https://golang.org/dl/

Once you have Golang installed, follow the steps below to build the autoproofcli project:

1. Clone the autoproof CLI repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/autoproof/cli.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```
   cd cli
   ```

3. Build the project using the `go build` command:

   ```
   go build -o autoproofcli
   ```

   This command will compile the project and create an executable binary called `autoproofcli`.


## Usage

After you have built or installed the `autoproofcli` binary, you can use it by running the executable from the 
command line. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
autoproofcli command [arguments]
```

Replace `command` with the specific command you want to execute and provide any required arguments. You can find 
information about available commands and their usage in the project documentation or by running `autoproofcli --help`.
